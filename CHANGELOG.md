# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-26)

- **New agent `researcher`:**
  - `brief` mode: sourced facts before a phase or task;
  - `fact-check` mode: verifies the claims in docs, plans and PRs;
  - every claim carries a URL, date and quote, or is marked UNVERIFIED; read-only, and never decides.
- **Wired in:**
  - the Worker runs a research brief at each new phase;
  - the Reviewer and `delivery-reviewer` fact-check docs, research and fact-asserting PRs;
  - `/autodeliver:loop` researches first when a task depends on external facts;
  - the docs and research profiles use the fact-check as proof;
  - `init` and `doctor` include the new agent.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-26)

First public release.
- **Commands:** `/autodeliver:init`, `/autodeliver:loop`, `/autodeliver:status` and `/autodeliver:doctor`.
- **Agents:** `delivery-reviewer`, `delivery-fixer`, `visual-checker`, `translation-reviewer` and `usage-inspector`.
- **Skill:** `autonomous-delivery`, with the playbook, the profiles (software, docs, data, infra, migration, research), and config and cloud-setup references.
- **Templates:** the five cloud routine prompts (Worker, Reviewer, Fixer, Usage inspector, Security sweep), the charter docs, and the staging ops gate.
- **Token log:** records token usage per role and round. It is on by default in new configs; set `"token_log": false` to turn it off.
- **Community:** issue and PR templates, a Code of Conduct, the CI validate workflow, and the plugin icon.
- **Docs:** GitHub trigger filters, the supported events, and dropped-event limits (cloud setup and lessons).
